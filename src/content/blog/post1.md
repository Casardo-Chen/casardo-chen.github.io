## Introduction
Computer science is one of the most gender-imbalanced engineering fields. According to the US Census Bureau (Martinez and Christnacht 2021), women only made up a quarter of the national computer workers in 2019. Although programming is often depicted as a men's job, seldom do people know that the world's first programmer was actually a woman, Ada Lovelace who designed the first algorithm to compute Bernoulli numbers in 1840. The portrait of programmers in the famous artificial intelligence ethics book Computer Power and Human Reason by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum(1976) aligned with the contemporary stereotype of programmers. It outlined a group of “bright, young men of disheveled appearance, often with sunken glowing eyes, can be seen sitting at computer consoles, their arms tensed and waiting to fire their fingers, already poised to strike…” (116). Such masculine smart nerds who are so obsessed with computers that they are detached from conventional social interactions contrasts with the low-status clerical feminine workers in the early stage of programming. The construction of engineer identity of programmers marked a turning point of such gender transition.
Prior to the 1960s, the majority of programmers did not hold advanced academic degrees and never identified themselves as engineers (Ensmenger 2012). The synergy of the increasing complexity of computer systems, the growing demand for software, and the need for efficient development management invoked the formal recognition and independence of software engineering in 1966 (Wirth 2008). Men took over software positions previously held by women, who were initially dominant in the field, as software engineering became a prestigious and lucrative career, and programmers became synonymous with software engineers (Ensmenger 2012).

This study argues that men utilized their pre-existing advantages in personal and professional authority to further solidify their dominance in this field as programming transitioned into an engineering discipline. In Section II, I will provide a definition of engineers, outline the strategies that reinforce their identity as white, male, and middle-class, and contextualize masculinity and femininity in occupation. Section III will consider the ENIAC project to examine the original programming job. Section IV will demonstrate the industry demand by aggregating job descriptions from the 1960s and 70s. Section V explores the impact of professional associations like Data Processing Management Association (DPMA) and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) on software engineering qualifications. In Section VI, I conclude with the culture and image of programmers after this transition. This research highlights professional associations, higher education requirements, and masculine rhetoric which exacerbated the gender disparity in programming.

## Literature Review and Background
Engineers encompass a range of disciplines that involve the application of scientific principles to design and construct useful systems. Ruth Oldenziel (1999) defines it as “a mass middle-class occupation with a hybrid form of professionalism and an almost knee-jerk aversion against classical blue-collar unionism” (52). The motivation to distinguish themselves from lower workers and to advance in the social hierarchy is fueled by academic engineering training, the establishment of professional associations, and the rhetoric of a position between labor and capital. Although Oldenziel(1999, 53) claims that engineers lack the gatekeeping mechanism of licensing or education, all of these attempts to elevate their status essentially promote whiteness and manliness in engineering, either consciously or unconsciously. This paper follows the endeavors to heighten engineers’ status outlined by Oldenziel and discusses their impact on gender disparity in programming.

Masculinity is typically associated with traditional values that are deemed masculine, such as strength, assertiveness, independence, and leadership. On the other hand, femininity is often linked with qualities like compassion, sensitivity, and meticulousness (Vetterling-Braggin 1982). The gender disparity in the workforce can be traced back to the conventional gendered division of labor in the family. As a result, the expectations and characteristics associated with different jobs within organizations often align with and reinforce this division, leading to the gendered segregation of professions (Martin 2003). Professions like banking, law, engineering, and medicine are often associated with masculinity, whereas assistive roles such as administrative assistants, paralegals, and nurses are typically associated with femininity (Wingfield 2009, 6). Such segregation was amplified in the STEM field. Women often choose to opt out of STEM fields due to a perceived lack of alignment between their gendered goals and the nature of STEM work: "agentic, thing-oriented, money, and status values” (Charlesworth and Mahzarin 2019, 7242). Sally Hacker (1981) found out that engineers tended to have more separation in their childhood from qualities and experiences that were commonly associated with femininity. They placed the highest level of importance on scientific abstraction and the least on feminine qualities on a continuum of social hierarchy. This research will use these definitions of masculinity and femininity to examine the course of the evolution of programming work into an engineering discipline.

Previous research on the gender imbalance issue in computing emphasizes the cultural aspects that expel women from computing, such as societal stereotypes and biases about gender and technology, lack of exposure to computing and technology education, and workplace cultures that are unwelcoming to women. Additionally, there is a perception that computer technology careers require long hours and are not compatible with family and caregiving responsibilities, which may deter women from pursuing these fields (Aspray 2016). In When Women Were Switches, Lipartito (1994) examined a similar gender transition pattern that took place in the telephony industry. He proposed that it is important to investigate the interplay of business strategies, technical artifacts, and work culture to comprehend the intricate changes that have influenced both genders in the industry. This paper will adopt a similar approach with a particular focus on the relationship of the significance of programming jobs to the profit in industry projects. As programming shifted towards more core, lucrative, and challenging work, the implications of programmers have also changed from assistive feminine jobs to middle-class masculine engineers, which has had an impact on gender proportion in the field. This paper aims to support prior findings by synthesizing and narrating the issue under the scheme of the desire for the prestige elevation of programmers.

## Before 1960: When Computer Was Human
Programmers had many overlaps with human computers, a type of worker who manually performs calculations, in the early twentieth century. Electronic computer systems always had a demand for low-educated and low-skilled programming labor to perform long and repetitive calculation tasks. Societal beliefs about women's gender roles and abilities matched the mechanical and tedious nature of calculating labor and accounted for why women were overlooked for technical and scientific jobs in the US Army Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) project. Moreover, the cost of hiring women was much less than men for the same work, which made them always an attractive option for human computer jobs (Aspray 2016).

The two world wars brought a significant demand for human computers conducting complex mathematical calculations for military purposes such as missile trajectory and nuclear particle tracks. The clear gender disparity in labor was explicitly shown in the ENIAC project, the world's first programmable computer project. Men were predominantly prevalent in the engineers’, officers’, and scientists’ positions and in charge of designing and constructing the electronic computer system, which was considered more challenging. In contrast, dozens of women were responsible for performing calculations for the development of the computer (Grier 2013). The subsequent operation of the computer was viewed as relatively trivial and therefore suitable to be delegated entirely to women. Six women were selected as the very first professional computer programmers. They were anticipated to use electronic computers to replicate the intricate computation for large-scale military projects already carried out by human computers. Kay Antonelli, one of the six programmers for ENIAC, was initially hired as a human computer, later invented and orchestrated programming techniques like subroutines and nested loops into a program that could carry out complex calculations, which in fact contributed to the foundation for software engineering until nowadays.

Even though the task involved the creation and design of new algorithms and techniques, programming was still deemed as an automated form of hand computation, the repetition and execution of existing rules. Consequently, programmers were grounded on nothing more than the traditional tasks of human computers in the early time of computing. Women who excelled in these tasks were often delegated to master the operations of the electronic equivalents, resulting in a natural transition for women to this new occupation.

## 1960-1980: Wanted! Computer Boys
The conventional dichotomy was that hardware was a men’s job as they involved the use of mechanical and electronic components, whereas software implementations were commonly assigned to women due to its perceived straightforward execution of a pre-determined plan (Haigh 2014). This perception changed as people began to recognize the complexity and significance of software development. Software engineering was first formally recognized as an engineering discipline by the ACM president Anthony A. Oettinger's Letter to the ACM Membership in 1966. He said in the letter, “We must recognize ourselves-not necessarily all of us, and not necessarily anyone of us all the time- as members of the engineering profession, be it hardware engineering or software engineering, a profession without artificial and irrelevant boundaries like that between 'scientific' and 'business' applications” (546). The boundary between computer design and implementation, hardware and software blurred. This demand for programmers began to grow in the 1950s with the widespread use of electronic computers and their application in the business world. Estimation suggested that there was a demand for 500,000 more men to write computer instructions in the mid 1960s (Englebart 1965). The pay for programmers also increased by 40 to 50 percent and programming was one of “the country’s highest-paid technological occupations”, which brought public attention to these lucrative opportunities (Bylinsky 1967, 140).

Although there was no consensus on the specific skill set a programmer should possess in the 1960s, it was becoming increasingly clear from job descriptions and advertisements that the need for creative and problem-solving skills was leading to a shift in expectations of proficiency in mathematics and engineering. IBM was a major computer manufacturer at the time. In two 1970 IBM recruiting flyers shown above, the qualification for programmers emphasized mathematical and logical thinking. The first flyer asks, "Do you enjoy algebra, geometry, or other logical operation… enjoy chess, bridge, and anagram”; the second flyer highlighted the math degree that the white male programmer earned. In the 1970 Allied Irish Bank programmer job qualification description, a bachelor's degree, or even a graduate degree in science or engineering was a necessity for systems programming positions. 

A systematic review of job advertisements for programmers from 1970 to 1990 categorized the necessary knowledge into three categories: technical (hardware/software), business (functional/management/social), and systems (problem-solving/development). In the review, technical knowledge was found to be the most referenced skill compared to business and system skills, with software requirements increasingly dominating the technical category from 82.9% in 1970 to 88.8% in 1990, followed by systems and business (Todd, James, and Gallupe 1995, 12). Programmer job advertisements that mentioned business skills increased by 20% from 30% in 1970 to 50% in 1990 (15). By the end of the 1960s, it became apparent that programming labor required more than just patience and attention to detail - it demanded a strong technical background and an increasing emphasis on business skills. The traditionally feminine characteristics associated with the job began to dissolve, and masculine traits were emphasized.

## Two Secret Weapons: Establishing a Professional Monopoly
Although the growing demand for technical requirements elevated the prestige of jobs, some programmers, most in academia and corporation, sought to establish a more conventional professional monopoly of expertise just as other engineers did several decades ago (Ensmenger 2015). The Data Processing Management Association (DPMA), found in 1949, administrated Certificate in Data Processing (CDP) to IT practitioners since 1961. To be qualified for the certificate, applicants are required to have adequate experience in IT, obtain a recommendation from a current CDP holder, and pass a rigorous 6-part written exam including hardware, operating systems, and programming with only a 38% pass rate in 1976 (Computerworld, 5). Of the individuals holding the CDP, 52.5% were in middle-level leadership positions such as project leaders or directors; 82.6% were male and only 16.3% were female (Mason 1984, 66). Requirements like recommendation letters and previous industry exposure facilitated a self-selection process that favored individuals who were similar to the original members, who were predominantly educated, masculine business managers. Over 55% of the CDP holders reported receiving at least one promotion after attaining CDP (77). The lack of CDP hindered women from advancing to managerial positions in the IT industry. While computer experts were increasingly seen as potential managers, women were excluded from these positions.
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) was established in 1947, following the Symposium on Large-Scale Digital Calculating Machinery held at Harvard, and has since become one of the most prominent academic computing associations. After Purdue established the very first computer science program in 1962, the number of bachelor computer science programs skyrocketed from 11 in 1964 to 92 in 1968 (153). When considering all similar programs, the number raised from 44 to 151 for bachelor’s, 61 to 137 for master’s, and 35 to 81 for Ph.D. during the same period (153). In March 1968, the ACM Curriculum Committee published its first course recommendations to initiate the institutionalization of computer science programs as an academic discipline. The diagram below exhibits the suggested mathematics and programming course roadmap for computer-science-related programs across the US.

12 mathematical courses make up one-third of the 30 required courses and serve as indirect prerequisites for 5 advanced computer science courses. “The Committee feels that an academic program in computer science must be well based in mathematics since computer science draws so heavily upon mathematical ideas and methods” (161). ACM’s inclination toward theoretical and mathematical knowledge appealed to academic scientific researchers who consist of the majority of the association. Only 5.9% of the members have less than a bachelor’s degree, 19 % have doctorates while another 37% have master's degrees, with 86.1% majoring in math, science, or engineering (D'Auria 1977, 689). Women and other underrepresented groups, however, were not common in academia and usually faced obstacles to acquiring such positions, resulting in an even lower rate than their participation in the computer industry. The numbers from the 1977 ACM Membership Profile showed a significant gender disparity in the organization: male members accounted for 87.5% of the total membership, while female members accounted for only 9.8% (689). 

## After 1980: The Carnival of Nerds
The evolution of programming into an engineering discipline has worsened the pre-existing gender stereotype by employing masculine rhetoric for programmers in public narration. In a 1967 article that appeared in Cosmopolitan, even the pioneer woman computer scientist Dr. Grace Hopper attributed women's aptitude for programming to their supposed abilities in areas such as meticulousness and patience (Mandel). However, around 1980, programmers were embedded with an image of a socially awkward but genius man as Weizenbaum described in his book. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are often idolized as the founders of modern computing, and their success has further solidified the stereotype of a male-dominated industry. (Ensmenger 2010) Hackers, a very masculine praise for technology experts, has become a synonym for advanced programmers since 1983. For instance, the movie in the same year, WarGames, featured a plot in which a talented young computer expert nearly triggered a global nuclear catastrophe while searching for a video game. This stereotype had a visual guide to what a “real” computer hacker looked like, contributing to the perception of computing as a primarily male-dominated field. (Ensmenger 2015) The drastic decline in the annual percent change of women's enrollment in computer science programs from 32,1% in 1983 to 20.4% in 1984 coincided with an increase in media mentions of the word "hacker" (Degree 2019). The prevalence of nerdy masculine cultures eventually expelled women from the work that they once practiced and excelled at.

## Conclusion
The nature of programming work has remained consistent throughout the 20th century, requiring a combination of creative crafting, logical operations, and mathematical analysis. Nevertheless, the portrayal of programmers has undergone notable gender disparity. This paper argues that it was not the nature of programming work that shapes the gender disparity. Instead, the redefinition of programming as an engineering discipline brought masculinity to this job. Throughout the systematic construction of professional barriers, programmers enhanced the prestige of this occupation but dismissed women from the field at the same time. Men consolidate their dominance in software engineering via leveraging their power in management and academia, evidenced by the way the CDP certification process favors managers and the establishment of ACM connects programming to mathematical requirements and college education. These factors contribute to a self-perpetuating cycle that is nearly impossible for women to break. Initially, programming was considered to be women's work, and consequently, viewed as low-skilled. However, as it evolved into engineering, it was seen as too difficult for women to participate in. People were not aware of the gender issue until the 1990s when the first ACM editorial pointed out the disparity. It summarized the obstacles women faced, "Difficulties with self-esteem, Lack of mentoring and role models, Gender discrimination, and Difficulties balancing career and family responsibilities" (Frenkel 1990, 46). This research disputes the rumor that women were not suitable for computing. The gender gap in programming is a product of the historical construction of the profession rather than of merit and intellect between genders. With women's enrollment in computer science programs still hovering around a low stage of 20% (Degree 2019), it is critical that we address the accumulating disadvantage and work to reconstruct women's confidence in their programming talent. By doing so, we can unleash the full potential of the programming industry and ensure that women are able to fully contribute their unique perspectives and expertise. Women not only have the capacity to excel in computing but also rightfully belong in this field, as they did 80 years ago.
